So a few weeks ago, I was playing the old Souls DLC in 1.3 with my sister, when suddenly, I'm heading up to space to explore, and the game lags BAD.
My solution? Recreate the entire mod after over a month of development just so I can play this in 1.4.
I have no clue if this has been created yet, and I probably should have checked beforehand, but at this point I'd rather play this anyway.
So, heres the old DLC recreated (except SOA doesn't exist).
Content:

Calamity: 24 Enchantments, 4 Forces, 2 Souls, and 1 Essence
Thorium: 66 Enchantments, 9 Forces, 3 Souls, and 2 Essences
Spirit: 26 Enchantments, 4 Forces, 1 Soul, and 0 Essences
DBZ: 1 Force

Planned Content:
Config Options
Clicker Class Soul/Essence (possibly a force as well)
Vitality Mod Soul/Essence (possibly a force as well)
-Open to suggestions-


Credit:
I want to note that I did not create this mod for any malicious intent, and I give full credit for all content to:
The creator of Fargos Souls DLC(which this mod gets most of it's content and assets from)
The creator of Fargo-Souls More Crossmod (Unofficial Addon) (which this mod gets all of its spirit mod additions from(would have used this one, but there were a few formatting things I preferred for this mod))

I'm not affiliated with these people at all, and this is a completely unofficial mod.
Enjoy!
